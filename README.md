# EXT: The File Processor

Convert your entire codebase into AI-ready plain text. No uploads, no limits, no configuration.

## Why?

AI tools reject your files. Upload limits. Format restrictions. You waste time copy-pasting 50 files manually.

EXT processes entire directories into plain text optimized for AI context windows. Select folder, choose files, download `.txt`, paste anywhere.

## Features

- **Directory Upload** - Process entire folders at once
- **Smart Selection** - Include/exclude specific files
- **Syntax Highlighting** - Preview code with 15+ language support
- **Language Breakdown** - GitHub-style distribution bar
- **One-Click Download** - Export formatted plain text
- **Privacy-First** - Everything runs in your browser, zero uploads

## Usage

1. Select files or directory
2. Choose what to include
3. Process and preview
4. Download as `.txt`

## Privacy

**Your code never leaves your machine.** All processing happens locally in your browser. No servers, no tracking, no uploads.
